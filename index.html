      <h1>OTP Developer and Product Owner Days 2024 Berlin</h1>
      <h3>October 7-11 2024 (developers), October 8-9 2024 (POs)</h3>
      <p>The OTP developers are meeting in October in Berlin to discuss technical topics and to socialise. Even though this mini-conference is focussed on technical details everybody is welcome and just listening in is totally fine.</p>
      <p>The OTP Product Owners are meeting for two days to kick-start the process of increased effectiveness in the PO team through facilitated discussions on purpose and common goals, clarifications of expectations, and a way of working within the OTP community.</p>
      <p>The event is free.</p>
